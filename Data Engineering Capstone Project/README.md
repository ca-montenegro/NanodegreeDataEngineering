This capstone project is intended to cover the topics learned during this Nanodegree, and execute some final analysis over the data set so an analytics dashboard can be created in a further iteration. 

The results obtained from this data discovery can be useful to understand how the Tennis world has been moving during the years. So this data set analysis can be used by various actors such as national and world tennis federations, trainers, tennis players, and fans. They can also discover how was the performance of a player in some or specific tournaments, how that player had been developing his/her skills based on match results, and lots more of analysis. This project easily can be extended to a web app dashboard in which fans can execute user-friendly queries and discover new information.

Here we made use of some tools such as Spark and Pandas in a Python > 3.x environment

The project's plan is defined in the next steps:
1. Gather the required information, in this cause we're using an ATP Tennis Data Set that will be explained in the upcoming section
2. Analyze the documentation of the data to understand which analysis can be performed using the existing data
3. Extract the information into the current spark session, so the following data processing steps can be execute
4. Perform data cleaning removing unwanted data such as null, empty and duplicates tuples
5. Create the data pipeline in which spark is in charge of creating the tables based on the previous information
6. Run some quality checks after the pipeline is performed to be sure that the data is consistent
7. Perform some analytics query to show the potential of using spark and the created data model

You can find more information in the Jupyter Notebook file.
