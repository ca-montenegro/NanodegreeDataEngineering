# Nanodegree Data Engineering Udacity

## Content for Udacity's Data Engineering nanodegree

### Course 1: Data Modeling
In this course, you’ll learn to create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse
needs of data consumers. You’ll understand the differences between different data
models, and how to choose the appropriate data model for a given situation. You’ll also
build fluency in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.

#### Project: Data Modeling with Postgres and Apache Cassandra
In these projects, you’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify.
You’ll create a database and ETL pipeline, in both Postgres and Apache Cassandra,
designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. For
PostgreSQL, you will also define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into your new
tables. For Apache Cassandra, you will model your data so you can run specific queries
provided by the analytics team at Sparkify.

### Course 2: Cloud Data Warehouses
In this course, you’ll learn to create cloud-based data warehouses. You’ll sharpen your data
warehousing skills, deepen your understanding of data infrastructure, and be introduced
to data engineering on the cloud using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

#### Project 2: Data Infrastructure on the Cloud
In this project, you are tasked with building an ELT pipeline that extracts their data from S3,
stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their
analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

### Course 3: Data Lakes with Spark
In this course, you will learn more about the big data ecosystem and how to use Spark to
work with massive datasets. You’ll also learn about how to store big data in a data lake and
query it with Spark.

#### Project 3: Big Data with Spark
In this project, you'll build an ETL pipeline for a data lake. The data resides in S3, in a
directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata
on the songs in the app. You will load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables
using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using
AWS.

### Course 4: Automate Data Pipelines
In this course, you’ll learn to schedule, automate, and monitor data pipelines using Apache
Airflow. You’ll learn to run data quality checks, track data lineage, and work with data
pipelines in production

#### Project: Data Pipelines with Airflow
In this project, you’ll continue your work on the music streaming company’s data
infrastructure by creating and automating a set of data pipelines. You’ll configure and
schedule data pipelines with Airflow and monitor and debug production pipelines.

### Data Engineering Nanodegree Capstone Project
The purpose of the data engineering capstone project is to give you a chance to combine
what you've learned throughout the program. This project will be an important part of your
portfolio that will help you achieve your data engineering-related career goals.
In this project, you'll define the scope of the project and the data you'll be working with.
We'll provide guidelines, suggestions, tips, and resources to help you be successful, but
your project will be unique to you. You'll gather data from several different data sources;
transform, combine, and summarize it; and create a clean database for others to analyze.
